                    <p>Girls do more to uplift their families and communities than men. This is well established. 
                       They are also provided far fewer opportunities in this world than their male counterparts.</p>
                    <p>In recognition of above, Masinyusane has invested millions of rand in sending talented young 
                       female students to university and creating a generation of female leaders.</p>
                    <p>We are impossibly proud of these young woman and look forward to seeing them enter fields 
                       ranging from Engineering to Law.</p>

                <p>Masinyusane's scholarship fund ensures that all learners qualifying from university from Port 
                   Elizabeth's 35 township high schools has the opportunity to continue their education.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to flood the township with graduates empowered to uplift their own families,

                    <p>Our students lack access to more than just tuition. They are unable to borrow funds to live on campus, 
                       are forced to live in crowded, impoverished homes and commute more than an hour each day.</p>
                    <p>Many struggle to find bus fare and few eat during the day. To combat this, Masinyusane distributes 
                       food and bus fare stipends every week.</p>
                    <p>We also run two Masinyusane Houses of Excellence that provide free, safe housing to our most 
                       impoverished students.</p>

                <p>Many of our students struggle with the transition from all-Xhosa high schools to multi-cultural, 
                   English-speaking universities. This is compounded by no longer being the big fish in the small pond.</p>
                <p>In response, our team of mentors work closely with our students every day to ensure they receive 
                   the support, motivation, love and guidance needed to navigate their studies and the inevitable tough times.</p>

                    <p>Masinyusane runs a massive logistics operation ensuring learners from all 35 Port Elizabeth township 
                       high schools are applying on-time, and correctly, to universities, financial aid, and scholarships.</p>
                    <p>This process is expensive, confusing, and time-consuming. Years ago, our needs analysis showed that 
                       only 14% of our Top Learners were applying for university correctly and on-time.</p>
                    <p>With our assistance, that number is now over 90% every year.</p>
